## Handwritten Character Recognition

This repository contains a deep learning model for handwritten character recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high-accuracy classification.

----

## Dataset

The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, stored in mnist-original.mat, which includes 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is preprocessed before training to enhance model performance.

----

## Dataset Preprocessing

-The pixel values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1.

-The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

-Labels are converted into categorical format for multi-class classification.

----

## Features

This repository includes:

-A TensorFlow and Keras-based deep learning model.

-Data preprocessing (normalization and reshaping) for efficient learning.

-A CNN architecture designed for digit recognition.

-Model training and validation with performance metrics (accuracy and loss).

-Visualizations for data samples, training progress, and predictions.

----
